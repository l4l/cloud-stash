Cloud storage services are widely used in the Internet. The only problem is the limited storage capacity, that can be solved in two ways. The first one is simply pay for the additional bytes, and the second way is creation of the new account and trying to keep in mind where's the particular file is. This project is aimed at automation of the last discussed routine.
